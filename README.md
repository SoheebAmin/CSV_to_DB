# My Code

This repo is to upload and keep a record of any original programming work of mine. Most programs are written in python, with some assignments written in C.

There are three types of projects recorded here:

## Assigned Projects

This is code I wrote to complete projects for programming classes. They only consist of projects where the code had to be entirely written myself without any boilerplate code. They are select projects that I thought worth saving for one reason or another. Each project comes with a Readme to explain what it does and how to use it.

## Personal Projects

This is code I wrote for personal projects (currently empty).

## Nifty Programs

This is code I wrote to make some small, practical programs that can possibly come in handy for some tasks, or were at least a way for me to practice some code and are worth keeping for review, or to help someone else. Each program will have a readme to explain anything you would need to know about it.
