# My Code

This repo is to upload and keep a record of any original programming work of mine. Most programs are written in python, with some assignments written in C.

There are three types of projects recorded here:

## Assigned Projects

This is code I wrote to complete online projects.

## Personal Projects

This is code I wrote for a personal project (currently empty)

## Small Programs

This is code I wrote to make some small, practical programs that can come in handy for me or someone else one day.
