# CS50 Assignment: DNA

This is one of the few assignments from Harvard's CS50 with no boiler-plate code, and instead, it is to be written from start to finish with one's own approach. The code itself can be re-purposed for broader pattern-matching, so I thought it worth including here.

The actual DNA assignment can be found [here](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/6/dna "DNA Link").
