# Web Crawler Final Project for Udacity 101

Once upon a time, the Udacity 101 course was considered the "go to" to start one's journey into programming. This was stil the case when I started python programming in early 2019.

By virtue of the code being in Python 2, you can probably tell it is a little outdated, but it the first major project in programming that I completed.

The final had no boilerplate code except for the network. The web crawler is the combination of self-made code elicited by different assignments throughout the course.
