# CS50 Assignment: Movies

This is a selection of more challenging problems put forth by CS50 in their 2019 class. I only included the final five, just to show my approach in solving SQL query challenges.

The SQL file includes the problems in comments, with my solution below. The database is also included, provided by CS50, which is a modified version of the data provided by IMDB.

The results of queries are not visible as the tuples can be in the thousands. The database is available to re-create the queries and confirm the solutions.
