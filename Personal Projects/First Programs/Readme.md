# For Nostalgia Purposes Only

This folder contains two text-based games that I wrote when I was first learning how to write python programs. They are poorly written but are still being kept so I can the first "long" programs I wrote.

From when they were first written in early 2019, their current verions have only been updated in two ways:

1. They were originally written for Python 2.7. I've used 2to3 to convert them to version that can run on Python 3.

2. I didn't believe in commenting back then. All comments were added when these files were uploaded.
