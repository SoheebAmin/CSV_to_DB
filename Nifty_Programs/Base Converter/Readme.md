# Base Converter 1.0

This program was also written early on in my programming career. It is simply converts decimal into any base up to 36, with alphabetical characters representing base 11 - 36 symbols, and no distinction between upper and lowercase.

There are probably dozens of websites that can do the same thing, but I wrote this on my own when I first took a lesson on hexidemical-based addresses, so I think it is worth keeping.
